<!--An image and a fictitious story-->
    <h2>A long story short<img class="me1" src="images/image1.jpg" alt="me1"></h2>
    <h3>Alex Tomson<br>Who could imagine...</h3>
    <p>At the time of Druids and Fairys, when everybody was resting, a thunder interupted their sleep.
    In the middle of the night, under the stars, among the animals protected him, it was he who was born.
    It was obvious, he was meant to be something different, something extraordinary.</p>
  <p>He was raised by the wild, in forests, having Wizards and Fairys for friends.</p>
  <p>At the age of 12 something happened that changed his life forever. He met the Great Master of Azarot (a small village in the mountains), who meant to be his mentor.</p>
  <p>It was he, the Great Master who introduced the young wilding to the civilization.</p>
  <p>The rest is a common story. School, college, university, girls, drinks etc ...</p>
  <h2>Really, now?</h2>
  <p>Well, ok. Being a student may be a little boring...</p>
  <p>As I said, I am a student. I study computing in Northampton University. I really like coding and this is something I wanted to do, since I was a child (not in the woods of course).</p>
