THIS ASSIGNMENT TOOK APPROXIMATELLY ______ HOURS.

BESIDES THE TEACHER IN CLASS, THE WWW.W3SCHOOLS.COM HELPED ME A LOT.
I ADVISED IT ALL THE TIME AND I AM USING IT AS A REFERENCE.

WHEN TRYING TO CHECK IF THE LINKS BETWEEN PAGES, WORKED THE LINK TO "HOME" DID NOT WORKED. ALL THE OTHERS WERE OK. HAVING SPENT ALMOST AN HOUR, FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A LINK INTO THE "INDEX" TO THE INDEX PAGE. DELETING THIS WORKED ALL THE OTHER LINKS TO THE " INDEX" PAGE.

I TRIED REALLY HARD AND FINALLY MANAGE TO INSERT GOOGLE MAP IN THE CONTACT PAGE, JUST TO FIND OUT THAT I WAS NOT ALLOWED AND DELETED IT.
