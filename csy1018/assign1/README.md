THIS ASSIGNMENT TOOK APPROXIMATELLY 38 HOURS.

BESIDES THE TUTOR IN CLASS, THE WWW.W3SCHOOLS.COM HELPED ME A LOT.
I ADVISED IT ALL THE TIME AND I AM USING IT AS A REFERENCE.

IN THE SUBMITING FOLDER THERE ARE FOUR HTML FILES.
THERE IS THE "HOME" PAGE (INDEX.HTML) WHICH CONTAINS A BANNER AND TWO PHOTOS.
THERE IS TEXT ON THE BANNER. THE PHOTOS ARE LINKS TO BIO.HTML AND TO RESUME.HTML. THERE ARE ANCORS TOO.
THE "ABOUT" PAGE (BIO.HTML) HAS A FICTITIOUS STORY, A LINK TO "CONTACT" PAGE AND A PHOTO.
CV PAGE (RESUME.HTML) CONTAINS LISTS, A SHORT TEXT AND LINKS.
FINALLY, THE CONTACT PAGE HAS A TEXT, FORMS AND LABELS. ALL FANCTIONS WORK PROPERLY.
PHONES, EMAILS EVEN THE FACEBOOK LINK. ALL ARE FICTITIOUS BUT WORKING.

ALL HTML FILES HAVE A HEADER AND A FOOTER.
THE HEADERS HAVE A LIST WITH LINKS TO OTHER PAGES.
THE FOOTERS HAVE THE MEANS TO CONTACT AND THE ICONS.

USED GOOGLE FONTS, ICONS AND THE UI STYLE GUIDE.
THE PHOTOS USED ARE NOT COPYRIGHTED.

AT THE BEGGINING, I MADE THE HEADERS AND THE FOOTERS TO ALL HTML PAGES.
THEN, THE CSS FILE. THIS WAS THE DIFFICULT PART. I WROTE SOMETHING IN THE HTML AND FORMED IT AT ONCE, IN CSS.
THIS WAY, STEP BY STEP, THE PAGES WERE MADE. I HAD A FEW PROBLEMS WHICH I ANALYSE BELOW.

WHEN TRYING TO CHECK THE LINKS BETWEEN PAGES, THE LINK FROM EVERY PAGE TO "HOME" DID NOT WORK. ALL THE OTHERS WERE OK.
HAVING SPENT ALMOST TWO HOURS, I FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A LINK INTO THE INDEX.HTML TO THE INDEX PAGE WHICH WAS NOT WORKING.
DELETING THIS, ALL THE OTHER LINKS TO THE "INDEX" PAGE WORKED. THEN MADE IT AGAIN AND EVERYTHING WORKED NORMALLY.

I TRIED REALLY HARD AND FINALLY MANAGE TO INSERT GOOGLE MAP IN THE CONTACT PAGE.
IT WAS JUST TO FIND OUT THAT I WAS NOT ALLOWED DOING THIS AND DELETED IT.

A FEW DIFFICULTIES MET WHEN TRYING TO INSERT PHOTOS. PROBLEMS WITH POSSITION AND SETTING TEXT IN IT, BUT BEEN RESOLVED RATHER QUICKLY.

THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THE FORMS IN THE CONTACT PAGE. I COULD SAY THAT I WAS EXPECTING MUCH MORE TIME TO BE SPENT.

ALL THE HTML PAGES AND THE CSS FILE PASS THE VALIDATORS WITH NO WARNINGS AT ALL.
ALL LINKS WORK PROPERLY.

IT WAS QUITE SATISFIED SEEING THE ASSIGNMENT FINISHED.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
