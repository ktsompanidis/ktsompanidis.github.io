THIS ASSIGNMENT TOOK APPROXIMATELLY 38 HOURS.

BESIDES THE TUTOR IN CLASS, THE WWW.W3SCHOOLS.COM HELPED ME A LOT.
I ADVISED IT ALL THE TIME AND I AM USING IT AS A REFERENCE.

FIRST I MADE THE HEADERS AND THE FOOTERS TO ALL HTML PAGES. THEN THE CSS FILE WAS THE DIFFICULT PART. I WROTE SOMETHING IN THE HTML AND FOMRED IT AT ONCE IN CSS. SO STEP BY STEP THE PAGES WERE MADE. HAD A FEW PROBLEMS WHICH I WILL ANALYSE BELOW. IT WAS QUITE SATISFIED SEEING IT FINISHED.

WHEN TRYING TO CHECK IF THE LINKS BETWEEN PAGES WORKED, THE LINK FROM EVERY PAGE TO "HOME" DID NOT WORK. ALL THE OTHERS WERE OK. HAVING SPENT ALMOST TWO HOURS, I FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A LINK INTO THE "INDEX.HTML" TO THE INDEX PAGE. DELETING THIS, ALL THE OTHER LINKS TO THE "INDEX" PAGE WORKED. THEN MADE IT AGAIN AND EVERYTHING WAS WORKING NORMALLY.

I TRIED REALLY HARD AND FINALLY MANAGE TO INSERT GOOGLE MAP IN THE CONTACT PAGE, JUST TO FIND OUT THAT I WAS NOT ALLOWED AND DELETED IT.

A FEW DIFFICULTIES MET WHEN TRYING TO INSERT PHOTOS. PROBLEMS WITH POSSITION AND SETTING TEXT IN IT, BUT BEEN RESOLVED QUITE QUICKLY.

THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THE FORMS IN THE CONTACT PAGE. I COULD SAY THAT I WAS EXPECTING MUCH MORE TIME TO BE SPENT.
